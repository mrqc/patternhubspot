# Conway’s Law — Organizational Team Pattern

## Pattern Name and Classification

-   **Name:** Conway’s Law
    
-   **Classification:** **Sociotechnical organization** pattern (org structure ↔ system architecture coupling)
    

## Intent

Recognize and intentionally **shape the correspondence** between your organization’s **communication structures** and the **architecture** of the systems you build. Use this understanding to **reduce friction**, **improve modularity**, and **accelerate delivery** by aligning teams with desired system boundaries (or vice versa).

## Also Known As

-   Organizational Mirroring
    
-   Homomorphic Systems
    
-   **Reverse Conway Maneuver** (tactic to change org to get a desired architecture)
    

## Motivation (Forces)

-   **Communication paths define design paths:** People optimize for who they talk to.
    
-   **Cognitive load:** Teams partition complexity along communication seams.
    
-   **Coordination costs:** Cross-team dependencies slow flow if the architecture cuts across team boundaries.
    
-   **Evolution pressure:** Architecture drifts toward the current org chart unless actively countered.
    
-   **Regulatory/safety constraints:** Interfaces harden where ownership and accountability are clear.
    

**Tensions**

-   Org reality (budgets, reporting lines) may conflict with ideal architecture.
    
-   Over-alignment risks **local optimization** and duplicated tooling.
    
-   Frequent reorgs can destabilize ownership and erode architectural integrity.
    

## Applicability

Use Conway’s Law deliberately when:

-   Designing or refactoring **architecture** (microservices, domains, platforms).
    
-   Scaling from one team to many and creating **bounded contexts**.
    
-   Introducing **platform teams** and paved paths.
    
-   You see chronic **cross-team bottlenecks** or “architectural grief” (lots of handoffs).
    

Be cautious when:

-   You have **tiny organizations** (one team—keep it simple).
    
-   Subsystems are **truly shared** and require a **Complicated Subsystem Team** rather than splitting.
    

## Structure

```css
Organization (people & communication)         Software System (modules & interfaces)
 ┌───────────────────────────────────┐         ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
 │   Team A  ──── talks ──── Team B  │  ⇒      │   Module A ── depends on ── Module B │
 │   Team A  ──── talks ──── Team C  │         │   Module A ── API contracts ─ Module C│
 └───────────────────────────────────┘         └───────────────────────────────────┘

If Team A rarely talks to Team C, expect few stable A↔C interfaces and friction when forced.
Align desired module boundaries with **stable, purposeful** team communication paths.
```

## Participants

-   **Stream-aligned (feature/product) teams:** Own end-to-end slices of customer value.
    
-   **Platform teams:** Provide reusable paved paths and reduce cognitive load.
    
-   **Complicated Subsystem teams:** Own areas requiring deep expertise (e.g., ML, crypto).
    
-   **Enabling teams:** Coach others to adopt practices.
    
-   **Leadership/Architecture group:** Makes **interfaces and outcomes** explicit (not tasks).
    

## Collaboration

-   Define **Team APIs** (how teams interact): SLAs, RFC process, support hours.
    
-   Use **contracts** (API specs, event schemas) to mirror communication.
    
-   Apply **Reverse Conway Maneuver**: change team boundaries to induce desired software boundaries.
    
-   Hold **lightweight architecture reviews** focused on **team ↔ module** alignment, not gatekeeping.
    
-   Track **dependency + communication maps** (who talks to whom vs. who depends on whom).
    

## Consequences

**Benefits**

-   Lower coordination costs and fewer handoffs.
    
-   Cleaner interfaces and **faster flow** through autonomous teams.
    
-   Architecture that **evolves predictably** with the org.
    
-   Clear ownership → better reliability and incident response.
    

**Liabilities**

-   Over-fitting architecture to current org can calcify design.
    
-   Reorgs are disruptive; use sparingly and purposefully.
    
-   Misread the boundaries → create **accidental monoliths** or chatty microservices.
    
-   Shadow dependencies if communication doesn’t match technical coupling.
    

## Implementation

1.  **Map the system and the org:**
    
    -   Draw module/service dependency graphs.
        
    -   Draw team ownership and **actual** communication paths (Slack, meetings, on-call escalations).
        
2.  **Measure alignment:**
    
    -   % of dependencies **within** a team vs. **across** teams.
        
    -   For each cross-team dependency, is there **regular communication**?
        
3.  **Choose a strategy:**
    
    -   **Align teams to architecture** (Reverse Conway) when you know the desired bounded contexts.
        
    -   **Refactor architecture to team seams** when org change isn’t feasible.
        
4.  **Harden interfaces:** APIs/events, versioning, SLOs. Prefer **team-owned contracts** over shared DBs.
    
5.  **Establish Team APIs & paved paths:** Templates, CI images, SDKs; make the easy path the right path.
    
6.  **Create feedback loops:** Quarterly reviews of **alignment metrics**; incident postmortems include org/arch fit.
    
7.  **Evolve safely:** Pilot changes on one slice; use **feature toggles** and **gradual ownership transfers**.

## Sample Code (Java) — Conway Alignment Analyzer

> A tiny utility that models teams, components, dependencies, and communication links.  
> It prints an **alignment score**, flags **mismatches** (cross-team deps without talk paths), and suggests **component moves** to improve alignment.

  // ----- Demo dataset -----
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Team payments = new Team("Payments");
    Team checkout = new Team("Checkout");
    Team mobile   = new Team("Mobile");
    Team platform = new Team("Platform");

    Component billingSvc = new Component("BillingService", payments);

        new Talk(mobile, platform)           // they do talk
        // Note: Mobile ↔ Checkout do NOT have a talk path → potential mismatch
    );

    System.out.println("Conway Alignment Analyzer\n");

    System.out.printf("Alignment score (intra-team deps / total): %.2f%n", alignmentScore(deps));

    System.out.println("\nCross-team dependency counts:");
    crossTeamCounts(deps).forEach((k, v) -> System.out.println("  " + k + " : " + v));

    List<Dep> mismatches = riskyMismatches(deps, talks);
    if (mismatches.isEmpty()) {
      System.out.println("\nNo risky mismatches 🎉");
    } else {
      System.out.println("\nRisky mismatches (cross-team deps without communication):");
      mismatches.forEach(d ->
          System.out.println("  " + d + "  [" + d.from.owner.name + " ↔ " + d.to.owner.name + "]"));
    }

    suggestMove(comps, deps).ifPresent(s -> System.out.println("\nHeuristic suggestion: " + s));
  }
}
```

**What it tells you**

-   **Alignment score** close to 1.00 ⇒ dependencies mostly within team boundaries.
    
-   **Risky mismatches** highlight where the architecture forces coordination **without** a talk path → fix via Team API, ownership change, or interface redesign.
    
-   **Heuristic move** suggests a component relocation to reduce cross-team coupling (a “micro Reverse Conway maneuver”).

## Known Uses

-   Large-scale systems (financial services, commerce, streaming, cloud) deliberately align **bounded contexts** and **two-pizza teams** with service boundaries.
    
-   Organizations running platform strategies align **platform teams** with **shared subsystems** and **stream-aligned teams** with products; architecture mirrors those seams.
    
-   Migrations to **microservices** often fail when the org remains **project/functional**—architecture reverts to monoliths reflecting the old structure.
    

## Related Patterns

-   **Agile Squad / Stream-aligned Team:** Delivery units whose boundaries should map to architectural contexts.
    
-   **Platform Team / Enabling Team:** Provide shared services and coaching that shape communication and, therefore, architecture.
    
-   **Complicated Subsystem Team:** When complexity demands a specialist core whose API is consumed by many teams.
    
-   **Service-per-Team (Microservice Ownership):** Architectural reflection of team boundaries.
    
-   **API Gateway / Team API:** Mechanisms that formalize inter-team communication into stable interfaces.
    
-   **Reverse Conway Maneuver:** Strategy to change org structure to obtain desired architecture.

### Practical Guidance

-   **Visualize both graphs:** module dependencies and team communication. Misalignments drive rework.
    
-   Prefer **long-lived teams** with clear ownership; avoid hop-by-hop projects.
    
-   Make **contracts explicit** (APIs/events/SLOs) and guard with versioning and CI contract tests.
    
-   Use **platforms** to absorb cross-cutting concerns; keep stream-aligned teams focused on user value.
    
-   Revisit alignment **quarterly**; small targeted changes beat broad reorgs.
